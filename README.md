- Hi, I’m @manol1945; my field is verification of steel marine structures which I am practising for the last 42 years
- I’m interested in structural dynamics, fatigue, kinetic structures and lately in data driven science and engineering
- I’m currently building a predictive model for the performance of photovoltaic panels using the measurements from our
panels at home and a tool for the identification of critical structural welded connections requiring in depth analysis by Finite Elements
- Are you wondering how was I introduced to Data Science? Well, during the covid-19 lockdown our daughter in law and our son who are in the USA directed me to the on-line courses at Harvard. I selected the Wrangling as I could not visualise (a) the scope and (b) never had heard of R! I followed a couple more courses which took me to the world of Data Driven Science and Engineering where I am lost!
